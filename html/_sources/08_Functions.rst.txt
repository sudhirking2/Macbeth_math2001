Functions
=========

So far in the book, we have studied properties of numbers (whether a number is odd, 
positive, prime; whether one number is divisible by another) and operations on
numbers (addition, greatest common divisor).

In this chapter we go up a level of abstraction, and study properties of and
operations on functions.  These new properties include: whether a function is
*injective*, *surjective*, *bijective*; whether one function is *inverse* to
another; and the operation of *composition*.

We also expand our horizon beyond the numeric types (:math:`\mathbb{N}`,
:math:`\mathbb{Z}`, :math:`\mathbb{Q}`, :math:`\mathbb{R}`) which have formed the
setting of the early part of the book.  We now start to work with a broader range
of types, including function types, finite inductive types, and product types.
