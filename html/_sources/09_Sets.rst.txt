Sets
====

This chapter introduces the language of *sets*, a convenient way to reason about the
objects in a type which have some property.  This language includes
the concept of *membership* in a set, the property of a set being a *subset* of
another set, and a whole zoo of set operations, such as *intersection*, *union* and
*complement*, each of which is a wrapper for a logical symbol relating
the underlying properties.

In the last section of the chapter, :numref:`Section %s <powerset>`, we study the
collection of sets in a type as a type in its own right.
