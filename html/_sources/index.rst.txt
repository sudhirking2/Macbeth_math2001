The mechanics of proof
======================

This is a set of lecture notes dealing with how to write careful, rigorous mathematical proofs.
The lecture notes are paired with code in the computer formalization language
`Lean <https://leanprover.github.io/about/>`_. Head over to the associated GitHub repository,
https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001, to download this code to your own computer or to open it in
the cloud on Gitpod.

These lecture notes are aimed at the early university level and have been written for the course
Math 2001, at Fordham University.  Please reach out to the author,
`Heather Macbeth <https://faculty.fordham.edu/hmacbeth1/>`_, with comments and corrections.
