Proofs by calculation
=====================

This book begins in the familiar world of numbers: :math:`\mathbb{N}`, the natural
numbers; :math:`\mathbb{Z}`, the integers; :math:`\mathbb{Q}`, the rational numbers;
and :math:`\mathbb{R}`, the real numbers.  We solve problems which feel pretty close
to high school algebra -- deducing equalities/inequalities from other
equalities/inequalities -- using a technique which is not usually taught in high
school algebra: building a single chain of expressions connecting the left-hand
side with the right.
