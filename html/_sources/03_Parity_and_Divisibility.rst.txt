.. _parity_and_divisibility:

Parity and divisibility
=======================

The problems in this chapter concern some elementary properties of natural numbers
and integers: *parity* (whether a number is *even* or *odd*), *divisibility*, and
*congruence modulo* :math:`n`.

There are no new logical symbols like :math:`\lor` or :math:`\exists` in this
chapter, and no major additions (such as the use of intermediate steps or lemmas)
to our reasoning toolkit.  Thus this chapter functions as a breather between the
hard work of :numref:`Chapter %s <proofs_with_structure>` and  
:numref:`Chapter %s <proofs_with_structure_ii>`, a chance to consolidate what you
have learned.
