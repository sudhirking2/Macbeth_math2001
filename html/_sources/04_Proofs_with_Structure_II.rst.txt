Proofs with structure, II
=========================

In the course of :numref:`Chapter %s <proofs_with_structure>`, we studied the
logical symbols :math:`\lor`, :math:`\land` and :math:`\exists`, which allow
complicated mathematical statements to be built up from simpler ones.  For each
such symbol, we learned its "grammar": the rule for using it when it appears in a
hypothesis and the rule for using it when it appears in the goal.  This grammar is
called `natural deduction <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction>`_.

This chapter finishes the work started in :numref:`Chapter %s <proofs_with_structure>`.
We learn the grammar of the remaining logical symbols: :math:`\forall`,
:math:`\to`, and :math:`\lnot`.  We also learn the grammar of two other logical
symbols, :math:`\leftrightarrow` and :math:`\exists!`, which are less fundamental
because they can be defined in terms of the other ones.
